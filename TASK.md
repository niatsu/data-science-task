# Candidate Task

## Objective
The goal of this task is to demonstrate your skills and thinking. You’ll be asked to briefly walk through your approach and reasoning during our next interview. Feel free to prepare a few bullet points, a whiteboard sketch, or some lightweight code snippets or notebooks — whatever helps you explain your thinking.

## Introduction
Niatsu wants to work with a dataset from global forest watch on tree cover loss. It measures areas of tree cover loss across the globe. Your task is to familiarize yourself with the dataset and come up with a solution to make the data more useful for Niatsu.

## Tasks
1. Familiarize yourself with the dataset:
   - Here you can see the data in the Earth Engine: https://glad.earthengine.app/view/global-forest-change#bl=off;old=off;dl=1;lon=62.43913566326864;lat=62.755440463950926;zoom=3;
   - Check out the documentation here: https://storage.googleapis.com/earthenginepartners-hansen/GFC-2023-v1.11/download.html
2. Let's say we have identified an area of interest (e.g., a country, region, or specific location). How would you make this data more accessible. If you download a tile covering parts of Europe, how would you match its data (e.g., tree loss per pixel) to administrative boundaries like countries or municipalities?
   - If you want to code feel free to download a tile (around 1.5 GB) and work with it in your local environment to match it to a country boundary.
   - If you need boundaries of countries, look here: https://www.naturalearthdata.com/
3. What framework would you use to make the data accessible. Let's say a customer wants data for a specific location but our dataset is only available on municipality level. How would you aggregate the data to this specific location?
4. Final step: If we want to work with this dataset - how would you reduce file size or simplify the dataset — and what kind of data accuracy might you lose by doing so?

## Expectations
- You can use code to come up with a solution OR prepare some notes.
- It is NOT expected that you have a fully functioning solution in code.
- You can use any libraries, AI tools or resources you want - we are looking for you approach to the problem.
